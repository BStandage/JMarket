JMarket is a marketplace system which allows users to buy, sell, and track a variety of items.

#### Sellers

When registering an account, sellers specify a username, email address, and password. Once registered, sellers are issued a unique ID number. Sellers have the ability to provide an inventory of items to be purchased by buyers within the system. Sellers can set the name, description, quantity, and price of the items they upload. Sellers are also able to manage and update the inventory, price, and description of items they own. 


#### Buyers

When registering an account, buyers specify a username, email address, and password. Once registered, buyers are issued a unique ID number. Buyers have the ability to search for items by either item name or item ID. Buyers are able to view the inventory of items and purchase items if they are in stock. 

#### Administrators 

Administrators have the responsibility to maintain and manage JMarket. Administrators can verify that purchased items have been shipped, as well as access buyer, seller, and item attributes. This includes a list of buyers, sellers, and items and their respective ID numbers. Administrators may also access buyer and seller account information such as username and email.
